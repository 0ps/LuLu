Full details and usage instructions can be found [here](https://objective-see.com/products/lulu.html). 

```
LuLu is currently in alpha. 

This means it is currently under active development and still contains known bugs. 
As such, installing it on any production systems is not recommended at this time! 

Also, as with any security tool, proactive attempts to specifically bypass LuLu's protections will likely succeed. 
By design, LuLu (currently) implements only limited 'self-defense' mechanisms.
