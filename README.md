Full details and usage instructions can be found [here](https://objective-see.com/products/lulu.html). 

**To Build**<br>
LuLu should build cleanly in Xcode (though you will have to remove code signing constraints, or replace with your own Apple developer/kernel code signing certificate).

**To Install**<br>
Simply run the installer application: `LuLu Installer.app`
